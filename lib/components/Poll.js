import React from 'react'

// React Terminology:
// A Component is a function returning parameterized virtual DOM elements.
//
// A React driver (React-DOM) will diff these returned DOM elements against the real DOM
// and issue imperative updates to bring it into sync with what the component's returned
// element tree looks like. Not much different than double-buffering in computer graphics.
//
// Encapsulation is achieved this way:
// - React does not know how you derive your element tree, or how often you will re-render
// - Your components don't reference the state of the DOM, only component {props} and state.
// - Data structures are descriptions of what should be; not prescribed changes.
//
// A component may be rendered through a class-based render(), or by returning them directly
// as below:
export default ({ prompt, choices, respondPoll }) => (<div>TODO display poll</div>)
